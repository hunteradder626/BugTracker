Ammend bug tracker was displaying out of order.

The list wasn't sorted and files when read back aren't in order, so readded the sort method into this function as well in order to see it properly

30:Dec:2021   This still doesn't work, thinking of putting it in a list to make it at least call able without having to copy and paste the file name. Might use a dictionary too. Or spliting the number from the rest of the file to at least be able to select a number BUT thoesn't allow for multiple numbers, and may cause issues with this.
